I've measured some statististic, which I believe gives me useful information about something I want to understand

# One-sample analysis

## Put error bars around it

https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.bootstrap.html#scipy.stats.bootstrap

why the bootstrap works - is it magic? rubin link

honorable mention to the jackknife

## Calculate a P-value

https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.monte_carlo_test.html

# Two-sample analyis: Is it significant?

https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.permutation_test.html#scipy.stats.permutation_test

Example: Did we move the left tail of the distribution. Statistic is the difference in the 5th percentile (a light version of integration from 0% to 5%)

WARNING: No power analysis
