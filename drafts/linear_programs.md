When and how to use linear programming

"Classic" examples and less classic ones

How to set up a linear program: Cost minimization

* Define the decision variables
* Define the cost of each decision
* Define the inputs and outputs
* Define the flow equations - these become equality constraints
* Define the limits to your inputs and outputs - these become the LEQ constraints
