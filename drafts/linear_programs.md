When and how to use linear programming

"Classic" examples and less classic ones

How to set up a linear program: Cost minimization

* Define the decision variables
* Define the cost of each decision
* Define the inputs and outputs
* Define the flow equations - these become equality constraints
* Define the limits to your inputs and outputs - these become the LEQ constraints

 Do I just need to set the costs to negative to make this a maximization problem? Does the above process still work if so? Like is the "material flow" interpretation the same

Minimum: Find the minimum-cost way to hit some production target on all the outputs
Maximum: Find the maximum-value way to use all the material present (then -c is the value vector)
