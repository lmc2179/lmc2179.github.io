A sprinkle of time series analysis to make your next metric review easier

# Metric reviews

If you're a working data scientist, at some point a very nervous, very tired product manager will contact you and ask you a question along the lines of this one: `okay I looked at the dashboard, our favorite metric just moved, does that mean something? should we do something?? WHAT DOES IT MEAN WHAT DO WE DO OH GOD OUR VP JUST PINGED ME WHAT DO I TELL`

Okay, okay, relax. You and your friend are going to be alright, even if the VP's chat window is showing an ominous little `hey` and some dots. You have a couple of goals right now:
1. First, look at the recent trajectory of the metric. Has it been changing in the direction we want it to move? Is it really volatile?
2. Given that perspective, is the most recent observation actually all that interesting? Is it far out of the ordinary compared to its historical values?

Let's see how we might answer these questions on some real data. Imagine, for example, that you're responsible for keeping an eye on how many trips drivers are doing on a ride-sharing app. (I don't actually have a ride-share app, but we'll use some daily numbers from the NYC Data tracker of number of trips). You want this number to go up (why?)

Imagine that you're looking at this plot:

Okay, looks like things have been going well - the metric looks like it has been growing on average, so that's good.

We're pretty sure that in our business, there is yearly cycle. So we'll take YoY change

It looks like year-over-year growth has been positive, so that's good. Has it been decelerating? from the plot alone, that's not totally clear.

how about the most recent month's observation - is that surprising? sometimes you should look closer/take action. is this month one of those times

Let's get a deeper look by going further into this YoY data set.

# What's the average recent growth? Is it positive, is it negative?

Lets start by getting the context. Before this month, what was growth like?

avg growth = 0?

Lets imagine a simple model that might have generated this data, in which growth is constant. In this "constant growth model", our observed YoY values are generated by

$y_t \sim c + \epsilon$

we fit a model, and check coefficient on $c$. note the AR model for correct standard errors

regression output goes here

okay, not a big surprise. the average month has a YoY growth of ..., and the CI is small/well above significance

# Is growth accelerating? Decelerating?

Growth is positive, that's good. Which direction has it been moving in? Has it been going up, down, staying in the same spot? We can look at the acceleration of the metric in each month; how much growth has been changing month-to-month.

acceleration = 0?

imagine a "constant acceleration model". it looks like

fit $y_t \sim \alpha y_{t-1}$

where the acceleration is $\alpha - 1$. if that's zero, growth isn't really changing month-to-month

okay, lets fit this model now. 

regression output goes here

hm, alright. on average, it looks like we saw some deceleration - the average month has X% less growth than the month before. but the amount is small, and it isn't statistically significantly different from 1, ie no acceleration

# Is the most recent observation anomalous?

So we know that recently growth has been positive, and hasn't really been accelerating or decelerating. given that context, how do this month's numbers look? we'll answer

is $y_{k+1}$ unusual compared to the set of similar points (ie, 12m)

simulate forecasted PI dist, look at pctile

# Some other things to consider

Are you on track to hit your goals for the month/quarter/half/year?
