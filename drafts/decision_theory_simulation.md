How not to run out of gin: Decision simulations with Python

Every analytics job I've ever had

# Anatomy of a decision

Leonard J. Savage's _The Foundations of Statistics_

Scenario: cards dealt, both known and unknown

Action: check/raise/fold. made without necessarily knowing all the information.

Consequence: result of the hand

# A real life analysis: How much raw material do we need to satisfy demand?

some realistic aspects: estimatimg inputs required for demand; lots of uncertainty; complicated process and multi-dimensional;

defining the SAC

running the simulations

picking one that doesn't fail

estimating the level of waste for our chosen decision

# Where do the scenario parameters come from?

elicit from expertise

predictive models

previous experiment results
