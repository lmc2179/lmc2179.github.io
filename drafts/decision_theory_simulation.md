How not to run out of gin: Decision simulations with Python

# what's in a decision

Leonard J. Savage's _The Foundations of Statistics_

Scenario: cards dealt, both known and unknown

Action: check/raise/fold. made without necessarily knowing all the information.

Consequence: result of the hand

# a real life scenario: how much raw material do we need to satisfy demand

some realistic aspects: estimatimg inputs required for demand; complicated process and multi-dimensional;

defining the SAC

running the simulations

picking one that doesn't fail

estimating the level of waste for our chosen decision

# where do scenarios come from

elicit from expertise

predictive models

previous experiment results

bayesian analysis

# appendix: a vectorized version

the above is cool but probably not the fastest
