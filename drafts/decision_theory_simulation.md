How not to run out of gin: Decision under uncertainty simulations with Python

Every analytics job I've ever had has required me to advise stakeholders and project the

# What exactly qualifies as a decision?

Leonard J. Savage's _The Foundations of Statistics_

Scenario: weather when you get off the train - rain or no rain

Action: go without umbrella, go with umbrella. made without necessarily knowing all the information.

Consequence: got wet or didn't

Find action which maximizes expected value (some alternatives are possible, discussed later)

# A real life analysis: How much raw material do we need to satisfy demand?

some realistic aspects: estimatimg inputs required for demand; lots of uncertainty; complicated process and multi-dimensional;

defining the SAC

running the simulations

picking one that doesn't fail

estimating the level of waste for our chosen decision

# Where do the scenario parameters come from?

elicit from expertise

predictive models

previous experiment results

bayesian analysis

check them against historical data and how well your assumptions matched with reality
