How not to run out of gin: Decision under uncertainty with simulations with Python

The reason we look at data is so we can make better decisions. However, even after consulting the data, there is still usually some uncertainty about the things we've studied. It's useful to have a framework to lean on as we think about how to make the best decisions we can.

# What exactly qualifies as a decision?

Leonard J. Savage's _The Foundations of Statistics_

Scenario: weather when you get off the train - rain or no rain

Action: go without umbrella, go with umbrella. made without necessarily knowing all the information.

Consequence: got wet or didn't

Consequences = Scenario-Action matrix

Find action which maximizes expected value (some alternatives are possible, discussed later)

show a little mathematical formulation of this

# A real life analysis: How much raw material do we need to satisfy demand?

some realistic aspects: estimatimg inputs required for demand; lots of uncertainty; complicated process and multi-dimensional;

defining the SAC

running the simulations

picking one that doesn't fail

estimating the level of waste for our chosen decision

# Where do the scenario parameters come from?

elicit from expertise

predictive models

previous experiment results

bayesian analysis

check them against historical data and how well your assumptions matched with reality
