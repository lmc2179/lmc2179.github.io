Having done some flavor of sciencing data for the last ten years, one of the most common questions I get from those starting out in Data Science is some verison of "what books should I be reading?". It's hard to answer this question directly, since the answer really depends on what you're looking to learn and what else you know. I could just list every book I've read, but as the old pretentious people of the past might say _ars longa, vita brevis_ - which roughly translates as "I don't have time to read all that, dude". Instead, I've done the next best thing, which is to try and list some of my favorite books which cover most of the fields I think about regularly. I've divided it into a few sections:

* Good reads: These are books that I found basically digestible from beginning to end. They are not all easy, but many of them function as readable overviews of their subject.
* Good references: These are books that I find more helpful to use as references, rather than as introductions to a topic. They may be good reads for you as well, but that can depend on your taste. They tend to be long and exhaustive.
* Snacktime: These are short reads which I think are generally accessible and worth reading through. Many of them not as far on the technical side; all of them have been major influences on how I think about data science.
* Dessert: Books that are not 

Keep in mind that this list is not-exhaustive and highly subjective. It's a guided tour of some resources I've found helpful, and perhaps you will too.
