Find the interesting units in your dataset - the extremes

Find out what a "normal" unit looks like

Predictive application: Calibrate level of error vs similarity to training set (???)

Anomaly detection application

Causal inference application: How much does the treated group look like the control group?

Can we use Shap with isoforest to understand why a particular unit is abnormal? **THAT** would be real cool
