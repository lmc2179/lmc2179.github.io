*Data science is a field with wide scope and tons of fancy tools. But don't be distracted - data science is fundamentally about using data to improve decision making. This is the common thread underlying all useful data analysis activities, and keeping that in mind will make you a better data scientist.*

>**Statisticians produce solutions to problems.** ... One cannot answer the question “what is important?” without first considering the question “important for what?”

--Giovanni Parmigiani, _Decision Theory_, On one possible way of describing the work of data analysis

> There is, then, no single, all-purpose, correct answer to a question implying measurement unless we specify the relevant local concerns that give rise to the question. 

--James C. Scott, _Seeing Like a State_, On measuring what matters to the circumstances at hand

# The most overhyped job of the 21st century

1. You give the data scientist access to your database.
2. The data scientist logs in, and performs a series of mystic incantations. They ✨deep learn the big data✨. They Hadoop the random forests. They write a bunch of unreadable equations on your office whiteboard, nod knowingly as they look out at the horizon, and smile as the immutable truths of the universe wash over them.
3. Revenue doubles overnight. Costs go to zero. Your company has an IPO for a bazillion dollars, and you end up on the cover of _Extremely Rich Tech Executive Magazine_, right next to the story about personal jets powered by bitcoin.

# So what is it that data scientists do?

Googling give us some almost-right answers. Various articles, blog posts, and other sources, tell us that data scientists are important because they...
- ...produce insights about the data
- ...use tools that make giant data sets manageable
- ...find and explain patterns
- ...build a theory of the business
- ...build and deploy models
- ...help the business test its ideas with experimentation

All of these are actually quite decent answers. Data scientists in different setting definitely do all these things - as a working data scientists, each of these is part of my professional life. But in the pre Data Science era, many businesses got along just fine without these things.  

The point of data scientists - the reason we do all the things in the list above - is to use data to _make better decisions_.

# The mantra of the pragmatic data scientist: "What's the decision?"

We sort important from useless information by thinking about whether the information is relevant to the decision at hand

# What does good decision making look like?

Decision process
Analysis --> Choice --> Evaluation --> Improvement

Good data scientists: How do I help make better decisions

Great data scientists: How do I design better decision processes, which accept feedback and scale with the organization

# Sidebar: What about other, similar job titles? Data analysts? Statisticians? ML engineers? Business analysts?

?

# Good organizational decision making means effective communication

# An example of good data science: Scaling A/B testing

I want to finish by telling a story that's about a topic that's near to my heart - A/B testing. It is a case study in successful scaling instantiation and scaling of a decision process
