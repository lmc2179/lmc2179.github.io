*Data science is a field with wide scope and tons of fancy tools. But don't be distracted - data science is fundamentally about using data to improve decision making. This is the common thread underlying all useful data analysis activities, and keeping that in mind will make you a better data scientist.*

>**Statisticians produce solutions to problems.** ... One cannot answer the question “what is important?” without first considering the question “important for what?”

--Giovanni Parmigiani, _Decision Theory_, On one possible way of describing the work of data analysis

> There is, then, no single, all-purpose, correct answer to a question implying measurement unless we specify the relevant local concerns that give rise to the question. 

--James C. Scott, _Seeing Like a State_, On measuring what matters to the circumstances at hand

# So what is it that data scientists do?

Googling give us some almost-right answers. Various articles, blog posts, and other sources, tell us that data scientists are important because they...
- ...produce insights about the data
- ...use tools that make giant data sets manageable
- ...find and explain patterns
- ...build a theory of the business
- ...build and deploy models
- ...help the business test its ideas with experimentation

All of these are actually quite decent answers. Data scientists in different setting definitely do all these things - as a working data scientists, each of these is part of my professional life. But in the pre Data Science era, many businesses got along just fine without these things.  

The point of data scientists - the reason we do all the things in the list above - is to use data to _make better decisions_.

Decision process
Analysis --> Choice --> Evaluation --> Improvement
