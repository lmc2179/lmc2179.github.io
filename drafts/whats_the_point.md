>*Statisticians produce solutions to problems.* Understanding data requires placing them in the context of scientific theories, which allow us to sort important from ancillary information. One cannot answer the question “what is important?” without first considering the question “important for what?”

--Giovanni Parmigiani, _Decision Theory_, On one possible way of describing the work of data analysis

Googling give us some almost-right answers:
- Data scientists produce insights about the data
- Data scientists use tools that make giant data sets manageable
- Data scientists find patterns
- Data scientists build a theory of the business
- Data scientists build and deploy models
- Data scientists help the business test its ideas with experimentation

All of these are actually quite decent answers. But the point is to do all this stuff to make better decisions

Decision process
Analysis --> Choice --> Evaluation --> Improvement
