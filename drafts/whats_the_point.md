*Data science is a field with wide scope and tons of fancy tools. But don't be distracted - data science is fundamentally about using data to improve decision making. This is the common thread underlying all useful data analysis activities, and keeping that in mind will make you a better data scientist.*

>**Statisticians produce solutions to problems.** Understanding data requires placing them in the context of scientific theories, which allow us to sort important from ancillary information. One cannot answer the question “what is important?” without first considering the question “important for what?”

--Giovanni Parmigiani, _Decision Theory_, On one possible way of describing the work of data analysis

> There is, then, no single, all-purpose, correct answer to a question implying measurement unless we specify the relevant local concerns that give rise to the question. Particular customs of measurement are thus situationally, temporally, and geographically bound.

--James C. Scott, _Seeing Like a State_, On measuring what matters to the circumstances at hand

Googling give us some almost-right answers:
- Data scientists produce insights about the data
- Data scientists use tools that make giant data sets manageable
- Data scientists find patterns
- Data scientists build a theory of the business
- Data scientists build and deploy models
- Data scientists help the business test its ideas with experimentation

All of these are actually quite decent answers. But the point is to do all this stuff to make better decisions

Decision process
Analysis --> Choice --> Evaluation --> Improvement
