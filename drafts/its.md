Interrupted time series analysis

Possible Example: Did Blazing Saddles kill the western?

Key idea: In the absence of an ironclad causal inference method (experiment, clear list of counfounders, instrumental variable), we often tend to use an informal "before vs after" look to make a guess about causal effects after an intervention is introduced. We might also include our historical knowledge of previous fluctuation levels, pre-treatment trends, and cyclic behavior, and attempt to synthesize them. This article is about ITS, the formal way of doing that.
