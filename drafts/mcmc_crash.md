# ?

For stats people but not Bayesians
Do not focus too much on frequentist/Bayesian diffs
Create a clear Bayesian Model building process; offload technical details to technical references

Why?
Note access to other methods that it allows, like hierarchical
Cite pragmatic statistics
Cite a strong defense of the Bayesian perspective

# What does a Bayesian Analysis look like?

The Bayes Playbook (Write down variables, priors, relationships, data, MCMC)

# ?

Examples: Usual normal, reduced normal

# Detour: What happened when we call the sample function

intuitive MCMC

# ?
Sampling statistics for diagnosing issues

# Good books on Bayesian Inference
