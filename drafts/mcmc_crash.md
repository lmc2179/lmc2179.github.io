# Everything you need to run a Bayesian analysis

I've met lots of folks who are interested in Bayesian methods but don't know where to start; this is for them

For stats people but not Bayesians

Do not focus too much on frequentist/Bayesian diffs

Create a clear Bayesian Model building process; offload technical details to technical references

Why?
* Note access to other methods that it allows, like hierarchical
* Cite pragmatic statistics
* Cite a strong defense of the Bayesian perspective

# What does a Bayesian Analysis look like?

The Bayes Playbook (Write down variables, priors, relationships, data, MCMC)

# ?

Examples: Usual normal, reduced normal

# Detour: What happened when we call the sample function

intuitive MCMC

# How do we know it worked

Sampling statistics for diagnosing issues

Model checks

Posterior Predictive

LOOCV?

# Good books on Bayesian Inference

Gelman
Kruschke

# Other cools Bayes-related libraries
