I need the standard error of something and it's not a "standard" statistic

Plan
* Understand the theory - what is the theorem?
* What is the proof? Something about a Taylor Series
* Find a good real-life example
* Do the math
* Sympy usage
* Numerical differentiation usage??

Desiderata
* When to use it
* How to use it
* A minimum of theory needed to understand it
* A clear worked example
