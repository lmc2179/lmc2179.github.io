
A step-by-step guide to propagating error using the Delta Method

# Error Propagation is Everywhere

Little sapling data scientists, coming up in the Garden of Analysis, learn early on that their best friend is the **sample mean**:

$$\hat{\mu} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{i=n} y_i$$

They also learn that statements about the sample mean are most useful if you calculate the **standard error of the sample mean**

$$\hat{SE}(\hat{\mu})= \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$$

This calculation is at the heart of many practical applications, especially, clinical trials and A/B tests.

There are lots of situations which go beyond this, and include **functions of the mean**. For experimentation especially, we often learn about the special case of the **difference in means**. But we can easily find others:

* Lift, or ratios
* Multiply by a constant (forex, yield)
* Retention <-> Churn
* We estimated an increase of \Delta in the input; how does it translate to a delta on the output if we know the production function
* Output of yearly revenue is a combination of many inputs

These are hard because we know the SE of inputs, but not the outputs. If you transformation has a nice form (and a 1st derivative), the delta method lets you propagate the error from the ones you know, to the ones you don't.

# How it works - Univariate

Each of the scenarios outlines has _a set of statistics with known standard errors_ (we'll call them $\theta$) as well as _a set of statistics with unknown standard errors_ (we'll call them $f(\theta)$). $f$ is the function mapping the two sets.

* For the ratio $f(\theta_1, \theta_2) = \frac{\theta_2}{\theta_1}$
* For the forex example, $f(\theta) = \alpha \theta$
* For the churn/retention example, $f(\theta) = \theta ^{-1}$
* For isoelastic input/output $f(\theta) = \alpha \theta^\beta$

Let's start with the univariate case. If $f(\theta)$ is our output, then

$\hat{SE}(f(\hat{\theta})) \approx \mid f^\prime (\hat{\theta}) \mid \times \hat{SE}(\hat{\theta}) $

And so an approximate asymptotic confidence interva for $f(\hat{\theta})$ is 

$f(\hat{\theta}) \pm z_{\alpha/2} \times \mid f^\prime (\hat{\theta}) \mid \times \hat{SE}(\hat{\theta})$

Under this approximation, note that
* The CI is larger for transformations that vary a lot at $\hat{\theta}$ due to the reliance on the first derivative
* The CI is smaller when the SE of $\hat{\theta}$ is smaller

The delta method tells us how much the function "inflates" the the SE of $\hat{\theta}$; it inflates it by $\mid f^\prime (\hat{\theta}) \mid$

Keep in mind that this is asymptotic. You can compare w/ bootstrap to verify

# Univariate example

# How it works - Multivariate

$\hat{SE}[f(\hat{\theta})] \approx \sqrt{\nabla f (\hat{\theta})^T Cov(\hat{\theta}) \nabla f (\hat{\theta})}$

Dimensions: (1) = (1 x k) (k x k) (k x 1)

Recall that $\nabla f (\hat{\theta})$ is the kx1 column vector of partial derivatives

When the elements of $\hat{\theta}$ are uncorrelated, then $Cov(\hat{\theta}) = I (\sigma_1^2, ..., \sigma_k^2)$, ie just the identity matrix with the main diagonals as the sd

and

$\hat{SE}[f(\hat{\theta})] = \sqrt{\sum_i \frac{df}{d\hat{\theta}}(\hat{\theta})^2 \times \sigma_i^2}$

# Multivariate example

# Intuition about the key theorem from Shalizi

1. Taylor series expand f (1st order/linear) around $\theta^*$, the true value. C.2, C.3, C.4.
2. Use rules for linear combination of variance to get C.8

# Other ideas: Alternatives to the delta method

Jackknife/bootstrap

Transform and OLS

Delta method relies on more assumptions but is much faster than the bootstrap

# Appendix:

## Difference of means (uncorrelated)

$\hat{\Delta} = \hat{\mu_2} - \hat{\mu_1}$

$\hat{SE}(\hat{\theta}) = \sqrt{1 \times \hat{SE}(\hat{\mu_2})^2 + (-1) \times \hat{SE}(\hat{\mu_1})^2} = \sqrt{\hat{SE}(\hat{\mu_2})^2 - \hat{SE}(\hat{\mu_1})^2}$

## Log of means

## Mean plus a constant

$\hat{\delta} = \alpha + \hat{\mu}$

$\hat{SE}(\hat{\delta}) = \hat{SE}(\hat{\mu})$

## Mean times a constant

$\hat{\delta} = \alpha \times \hat{\mu}$

$\hat{SE}(\hat{\delta}) = \alpha \times \hat{SE}(\hat{\mu})$

# Appendix: Multivariate Central Limit Theorem for multiple RVs $X_1, ..., X_k$

$MV Normal(\mu, Cov)$

$\mu = (\mathbb{E}[\mu_1], ..., \mathbb{E}[\mu_k]$)

$Cov = \frac{1}{n} \Sigma$, where $\Sigma$ is the covariance matrix of $X_1, ..., X_k$

# Draft

I need the standard error of something and it's not a "standard" statistic

so you need the variance of the sampling distribution of some statistic



Plan

âœ… Understand the theory - what is the relevant theorem? where does it originate?

From wikipedia - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance#Arbitrary_functions

If X is a random  variable, then:

$Var[f(X)] \approx (f'(\mathbb{E}[X]))^2 Var[X]$

(use this to derive a confidence interval and a hypothesis test by applying it to the sampling distribution)

multivariate version - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_method#Multivariate_delta_method

Double check but I think this _should_ work for X is multivariate, which becomes some scalar. like the ratio

$Var[f(X)] \approx\nabla f(X)^T Cov(X) \nabla f (X)$

$(1 \times k) (k \times k) (k \times 1)$

since it's a pretty elementary application of the taylor series, it was known sometime in the early 20th century

* Find a good real-life univariate example. maybe estimates of raw product and then production curve of finished product
* Do the math
* Sympy usage
* Numerical differentiation usage??
* What about the multivariate version? Maybe a simple example there too
* Write section 1: The common problem that the delta method solves, incl an example
* Write section 2: How to use it, in theory and with sympy/numerical analysis. Do simulation and confirm with bootstrap
* Write section 3: What about the multivariate case?
*  Other ways

Output
* When to use it
* How to use it
* A minimum of theory needed to understand it
* A clear worked example
