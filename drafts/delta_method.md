I need the standard error of something and it's not a "standard" statistic

Plan
* Understand the theory - what is the relevant theorem? where does it originate?
* What is the proof? Something about a Taylor Series
* Find a good real-life univariate example. How 
* Do the math
* Sympy usage
* Numerical differentiation usage??
* What about the multivariate version? Maybe a simple example there too
* Write section 1: The common problem that the delta method solves, incl an example
* Write section 2: How to use it, in theory and with sympy/numerical analysis
* Write section 3: What about the multivariate case?
*  Other ways

Output
* When to use it
* How to use it
* A minimum of theory needed to understand it
* A clear worked example
