how to help people grow to be more independent

1. show them how to solve it. do it for them the first time. tell them how to do it the next time. give them the answer.
2. don't give them the answer - ask them the question. what should we do next? what factors are important here? what's our goal?
3. don't ask the question - help _them_ ask the question. what did you consider so far? how did you approach the problem?
