# What we do and why

## What is a dag and why have one

## How data tells us about the causal graph

Simple example of a DAG; intuition about how it tells us about the DAG structure

## An example: housing prices

# How to do it

## Vars

## Constraints

## Inference

# Then what do you do with the graph

Big idea: (1) Learn graph from causal-learn, output as nx (2) Input to dowhy to get confounders, do estimates
