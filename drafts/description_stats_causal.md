Archetypes of analysis: Description, Statistical Inference, Causal Inference

Its tempting do be ambitious and have your analysis be a causal, scientific analysis, but it pays to start simple and work your way up to that

It's kind of an agile method: Collect data ↔️ Description ↔️ Statistical Inference ↔️ Causal Inference. Often you find gaps that prevent you from taking the next step up the ladder. the solution is to go get more data in those cases (link shoe leather paper)

What does each step _require_? Can your knowledge of the data and the DGP really provide it?

Level I: Describing the data

Level II: Statistical inference about a population

Level III: Causal inference about an intervention
