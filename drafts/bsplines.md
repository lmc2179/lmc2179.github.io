Bsplines rock and should be your go-to method for modeling smooth nonlinearities

How they work - Basis expansion and splines; Degree of spline, number of knots; start with low order and increase

Example: Non-linear relationship of NOX and Price in the Boston housing data

How to use them in Python

Graphing them with a PDP (?); plotting them somehow (what does this do if it's nonlinear: https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/generated/statsmodels.graphics.regressionplots.plot_partregress.html#statsmodels.graphics.regressionplots.plot_partregress)

Looking at CIs of the PDP
