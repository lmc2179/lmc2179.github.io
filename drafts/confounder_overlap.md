Checking for confounder overlap in observational studies

The intuitive reason we do experiments: it balances confounders

Sometimes we can't do an experiment, but was some experiment-like data, can we use that?

this will cover methods of verifying whether important variables are balanced across the treatment and control sets; randomized experiments should pass this perfectly, but observational analyis may not be  as perfect
