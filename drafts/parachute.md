How to learn about a new domain as a data scientist

# Professional life as a data scientist often means changing domains

As a data scientist, your skill set is powerful because it is very generally applicable. ML models and statistics give us ways to use data to understand the world and make decisions a little better, regardless of the domain

Despite this generality, YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE DOMAIN TO DO A GOOD JOB. I've developed a method that I use to do this

Over the last ten years, I've had a lot of jobs, and a lot of teams. I've been lucky! I've been able to work with so many interesting people, solving lots of interesting problems . even if you don't yet have my ~level of jaded frustration~ wealth of experience, maybe you:
* got a new job. congratulations!
* changed to a new team
* are a consultant

this post is meant to help you X. it is idiosyncratic, and reflects what has worked for me (it's what I used most recently to onboard at google)

it has three major components, performed roughly in order:
* talk
* actually access the data and do case studies, then see if your case intuition pans out
* look at metrics

# Talk: Get to know the team

### The goal: Meet everyone. understand what they do, and how they concieve of success for themselves/for the group, how you can help.

Talk talk talk talk talk!! you can't overdo this

Each of these includes themes that I try and piece together, which are included in **bold**. Each theme includes some specific questions you might ask. I try to cover all the themes, but I don't necessarily ask each question (and I may ask others besides).

There are three big things:
* The Org
* The Data
* The Projects

I've written this for organizations which use the PM-Analyst-Eng structure. your org may have only a subset, or other ones besides, or something else

## DS/Data team

Titles like: DS, Analyst, AE, Product Analyst

### Org
* **How is the org structured?** Are DS centralized or embedded?
* **How do you work with stakeholders/biz owners?**
* **How do you work with tech teams (non-biz)**
* **What are the goals and north star?**

### Data
* **How is the data generated, and how do you access it?** What are the data sources? Do analysts access a DW, or prod data, or...?
* **What metrics are implemented?**

### Projects
* **How do you plan and track projects?** Roadmap? Sprints?
* **How do you track deployed solutions?**  repo? model/system observability?
* **How do you understand key levers?** exp, ci, etc
* **Do you run experiments? How?** how many, how often, how long do they take? how do you think about power? how are decisions made? who owns the exp engine?

### stakeholders/partners/pms

Titles like: Product Manager, Marketer, Designer

sentence

* how do you keep an eye on the north star? do you take actions that move it directly, or a proxy metric? do you have goals for it?
* what levers do we have? what key decisions do we need to make?
* Main metrics? key subgroups? trends?
* biggest oppties, past+future?
* what are the key entities? key interactions? main dashes?
* roadmap? where is it, where does it come from, how are priorities set?



### Engineering/ops

Titles like: Software Engineer, Release Engineer, Eng manager

sentence

* what is the prod source?
* how are key levers controlled?
* how do experiments work?
* release cycle length?
* your key decisions, esp recurring?
* your metric goals? automation oppties?
* how do you support DS? ML Eng?
