Things I think about occasionally, sources which I've read or intend to read, and general explorations that might, someday, be usefull. Not necessarily things which revolve around the theme of data science, or any specific theme. Inspired by [Cosma Shalizi's _Notebooks_ page](http://bactra.org/notebooks/).
