title: Hello!

I'm Louis Cialdella, an NYC-based Data Scientist. I recently started as a Data Scientist at Facebook. Before that, I was on the Analytics team at ZipRecruiter, where I built tooling and methodology to support Zip's growth by building models, running experiments, conducting observational analysis, and helping stakeholders understand the business with data.

I'm especially excited about Bayesian statistics, Causal Inference, Experiment Design, and building effective data analysis teams.
