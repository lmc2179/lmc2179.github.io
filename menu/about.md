I'm Louis Cialdella, an NYC-based Data Scientist. I currently work as a Staff Data Scientist at Google, focusing on Google Workspace. If you're excited about experimentation, causal inference, and how data makes organizations better, I'd love to talk to you. You can contact me [here](https://louis.crd.co/). I'm especially excited about Bayesian statistics, Causal Inference, Experiment Design, and building effective data analysis teams.
